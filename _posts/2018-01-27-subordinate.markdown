Patriarchy should be defined in terms of the subordination rather than the oppression of women, and in the process, we can raise the question about the means of incorporating women into the system, since one does not wishes to become a subordinate willingly.

For a basic primer, paternalism is a gender based analog of maternalism, focussing on protection providing nature of man, just as its counterpart focuses on nurturing nature of woman gender. We’ll start off this analysis with a simple analogy. This would prevent ourselves from confusing our grounds during the course of further scrutiny.


Suppose there exist two far apart isolated islands named Egalitaro and Patriarcho amidst a large sea. Republic of Egalitaro is somewhat emancipated from any form of discrimination, whereas Patriarcho is more or less a biased state. Few years down the line, Egalitaro realizes that it is running out of food resources to run the state efficiently, so realising the scale of this problem, it decides to form a collusion with the government of Patriarcho, which in turn was lacking in a population of a much needed community of people, called femin with a specialised skill set.

As a result, the state of Egalitario made its population aware of the food scarcity and played with the psychology of femin community, stating that to ensure their survival, it is better for them to transfer to Patriarcho. The state also made them realise that in order to assist in their transfer, it would provide them with the boats and boat pilots, rather than asking them to swim all their way through. The state made sure that femins boarded the boat because otherwise they may swim off to other islands. The boats unloaded the food resources to Egalitario and transferred femin community to Patriarcho on its return journey.

Now, drawing the analogy, to incorporate women (femin) into the patriarchy (Patriarcho) system, the states used paternalistic dominance (boats and pilots), as the central means, which was an insidious move as ex hypothesi, femin community were being saved from being oppressed (avoid making them leave Egalitario forcefully making them swim their way into the sea), which is once again a way to tie them somewhat more.

Let’s now try to infer a conceptual relationship between the two entities named ‘Paternalistic Dominance’ and ‘Women Subordination’.

When I was spending my last vacations at home, I often observed that as soon as our maid received a phone call, she would race off back home. After a couple of weeks, she decided to quit working. Out of curiosity (not really), I asked my mother about the matter with this lady. She responded by saying that her husband works in a nearby factory, and the maid was working without his approval. This is where our analysis starts.

We are facing two possibilities here, either she fears that her husband would ask for share in her money if he comes to know about her working in households, or simply because he doesn’t like her to work because obviously, he is the expected Breadwinner for the family.

Considering the first possibility, it should be seen that the maid’s husband is himself a working man, and quite likely earns more than her. Therefore, the scenario of him asking for money from her seems to be very dubious, unless we really assume that he has drinking/smoking or other money flushing habits. If the family expenses are large, then too it doesn’t really make a difference as to which partner is bringing how much money, eliminating the possibility of him asking for money from her.

In case he actually demanded a share in the maid’s monthly wage, it would still be a positive deal for the maid, rather than to not work at all, since she would still have some minimal means of independence, and she would not quit.

Now that we have eliminated the first possibility, paternalistic dominance can now be introduced into the scene. The husband is not oppressing the maid, on the other hand, it can be argued that he is saving her from being ‘exploited’ for a nominal amount of money. Considering that the maid never had an education, all along while being fed with a subordinate psychology, she agreed to exchange herself for unpaid labor in return for ‘protection’ from her husband, which is precisely a trademark feature of paternalistic dominance.

One important question to ask is that did the maid always assume faults on her part, because her subordinate mentality always made her believe that it is her husband’s income which holds more importance? Or because she believes that her husband has the responsibility to protect her, so she should not go against him?

In this context, whether the maid assumed faults on her part is immaterial, since her hands are anyway tied, implying that she has to agree to kick her income source, or in other words, play a subordinate. Concept of paternalistic dominance turned her into that player. How? By affecting her psychology, which stops her from opposing her husband which even if she is an adult and has an equal right to livelihood.

In this personal experience, it can be said that the maid had to board the boat, even if she had some plans to swim her way to a different island.
