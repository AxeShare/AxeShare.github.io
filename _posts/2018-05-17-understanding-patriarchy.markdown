In this post, which is inspired from Lerner's work, we will try to get an overview of some approaches to understand the origin of patriarchy.

Traditionalist
Marxist/Materialsitic
Maternalist


While seeking more information on the topic, few texts came across me as a brilliant tour de force in the context of patriarchy. The society, whether from its prehistoric epoch transitioned into an era where religious thought was dominant, or transcended to an era where scientific thought began to penetrate the culture, the traditionalists always held onto their idea of Women subordination. Traditionalist allegiance laid primarily with biological determinism.

The only pursuit in which a traditionalist would acknowledge a woman, or rather a female to be precise, is her reproductive capacity and motherhood, which stands essential for survival of homo sapiens, failing to recognise any cultural/societal contribution from their side. Any argument which harms the their image of man-the-hunter, or bites off its undue credit, is unacceptable to a traditionalist.

Traditionalists argue that If our species has stood the test of time, the societal setting must be perfect, and should stay that way. Au fond, traditionalists have been extrapolating sexual differences between the two life forms to assign them their social forms or genders. They believe that the sexual asymmetry is created by the God and it perfectly makes sense for the two genders to have separate roles in society.

When the religious argument began to weaken somewhere around nineteenth century, traditionalists switched sides to the Darwinian idea of survival of the fittest, and women were kept from educational or vocational pursuits in lieu of biological phenomena such as menstruation, which they now believed render the women inferior.

One very basic flaw in traditionalist mindset by is that the traditionalists simply ignore the advent of technology, and development of culture which has significantly distanced this society of ours from the nature. The biological role of mother after child birth can somehow be replaced by literally anyone. Traditionalists fail to acknowledge this fact and expect women to perform same occupations/roles which were assigned to them for species survival in the Stone Age.

When we head towards a Marxist-Economic approach, or Materialist approach to patriarchy, we find that Frederick Engel in his work The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State describes Women subordination as an event which was derived from the development of private property. He referred to it as “the world historic defeat of the female sex”.


The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State
Engel claimed that men were basically developing a mindset to secure the surpluses from various occupations for themselves and their heirs, which they accomplished by indulging in monogamous relationship. Women’s sexuality was controlled to ensure of the legitimacy of their offspring.

As further political and cultural development occurred, patriarchy replaced the monogamous relationship in households, forfeiting any form of power withheld by the female sex. Engels weaved a linkage between economic-social change and gender relationships which could explain sexual conflict within the private property relations. He circulated the idea of monogamous marriage as “suppression of one sex by the other”.

This class antagonism explanation between the sexes proved to be a major roadblock between understanding of class relations and relation between sexes.

On the other hand, Claude Levi-Strauss developed a foundation for the functionalist approach to explain the female subordination, which took belief systems and mental constructs into picture instead of dealing with a narrow perspective of economics and biology. Levi-Strauss stated that the incest taboo lied at the root of social setting which exists till date, and which planted the tradition of exchange of women, who were then imposed upon a set of structures and relations.

It is also clear that Marxist approach to find out the origin of patriarchy does not lie upon the concept of universality as is foregrounded by the traditionalists. As mentioned above, even claims supported by economics and biology are not sufficient to find the ground causes, and thus is an intellectual challenge.

It is interesting that since this approach claims that the cause of women subordination is rise of private property and the related institutions, their demolition should logically liberate women, which is not the case, clearly. In fact, for the production of surplus, we needed labour, for which control over female sexuality was practiced, implying that patriarchy was established before the rise of private property.

The theoretical position which stands to a polar end of the traditionalist point of view is the Maternalist theory. It accepts the biological sex differences as given, and consider division of labour logical like the traditionalists, but reasons these differences for the women’s equal status or sometimes superiority. Matriarchy was a central concept to the idea of Maternalism, and hence is considered to be feminist-centric.

Maternalists often claim that women in prehistoric ages developed the culture for humans which translated them from barbaric ages to the modern society existing today. In other words, womanhood was seen in a positive light glorified by its traits like nurturance and altruism, which ci devant were considered for pushing women on the backfoot.

Maternalism blended with the nationalist philosophy and resulted in the origin of terms such as “mother of the republic”, since women were considered as better equipped to improve the society due to traits like virtuosity. Maternalist feminists argued for female superiority in the past using the ubiquitous evidence of Mother-Goddesses, found in many ancient religions and myths.

Maternalists are often objected for raising a mythical evidence for a historical evidence. In view of historical context, it has been shown that the status of women in these societies was actually low, in contrast to what is depicted by the Mother-Goddesses. What we can actually say is that the societies shifted from an egalitarian state to patriarchy, instead of matriarchy to patriarchy, as is claimed by the maternalists.
