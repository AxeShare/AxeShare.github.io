If you want to know my specifics, check my [CV][cv].

I am a fourth year undergraduate at Indian [Institute of Technology, Kanpur][iitk]. My hometown is New Delhi, and from there, I received my school education from [Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan][aps]. If I have something to present to you right here, it is my posts stacked up on the home page which are nothing but my thoughts and opinions about a number of social subjects, so of course you are free to disagree.

>People, be them engineers, journalists, philosophers, or even scientists who fail to develop an aesthetic component in their makeup are usually dry-as-dust pedants. For that reason, we must evoke our colorful imagery to guide us out of the forest of abstractions and establish one to one relationship between human and nature. 

>We write, not because we claim to know more than others, but perhaps because we want to know more than others. Writers are explorers.

Moving on further, the subjects which I have mentioned down below are ginormous, all of them, and I am often unqualified to talk about them, but nevertheless, this is my homepage and I going to take full leverage of it:P

General Interests:

1. English Literature
2. Political philosophy
3. Art history


Mathematics:

1. Probablity theory
2. Proof theory
3. Geometry and Topology


Biology:

1. Stochastic petri nets (in population biology)
2. Systems biology
3. Comparative genomics

Moreover, my fascination lies at the intersection of my interests, which is not always tractable.
So that about covers me up. I would love to know about you as well.
