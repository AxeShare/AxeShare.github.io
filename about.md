If you want to know my specifics, check my [CV][cv].

I am a third year bioengineering undergraduate at Indian [Institute of Technology, Kanpur][iitk]. My hometown is New Delhi, one of the most lively cities you must have heard of. From there, I received my school education from [Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan][aps]. Heck, even mentioning these names makes me feel wistful. My allegiance has always been with the use of technology for the greater good of humanity. Anyway, if I have something to present to you right here, it is my posts stacked up on the home page which are nothing but pristine creations of my own mental sentience. 

>People, be them engineers, journalists, philosophers, or even scientists who fail to develop an aesthetic component in their >makeup are usually dry-as-dust pedants. For that reason, we must evoke our colorful imagery to guide us out of the forest of >abstractions and establish one to one relationship between human and nature. 

Moving on further, the subjects which I have mentioned down below are ginormous, all of them, and I am often unqualified to talk about them, but nevertheless, they broadly represent my academic inclination.

General Interests:

1. Literature
2. Political Economy
3. History and its philosophy


Mathematics:

1. Probablity theory
2. Proof theory
3. Geometry and Topology


Biology:

1. Stochastic petri nets (in population biology)
2. Systems biology
4. Comparative genomics
6. Evo-Devo

Besides my academic pursuits, I like to read about social issues, very much, so much so that it might not take long for fight against all forms of discrimination and bigotry to become my life's integral component. I also take delight in music and art films.

So that about covers me up. I would love to know about you as well.
